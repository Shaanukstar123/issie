(*

 Needed for one part of project work (not for Tick 3):
    Sheet.getNewSegmentSnapInfo
    Sheet.getNewSymbolSnapInfo

 These functions can be changed to alter which things symbols or segments snap to:
 They are called at the start of a segment or symbol drag operation.

 If you want to change these inside a drag operation - you may need to alter other code.
 The snap code is all in one place and well-structured - it should be easy to change.
